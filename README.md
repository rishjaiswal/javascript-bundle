NOTE : JS can behave as an interpreted or a compiled language depending upon the JS Engine. It was
written initially to be used as an interpreter as it is mostly used in web browsers but later it is
used as both. So, it is called a JIT(Just-in-time) language.


## JS Engine 
- JS runtime environment consists of JS Engine, Web APIs, Event Loop, Callback Queue, microtask queue. JS Engine is the heart of JS runtime environment. Browser can only execute the JS code because it has JS runtime environment. Node.js has JS runtime environmet
- Different browsers have different JS Engine. For example Microsoft Edge: Chakra, Mozzila
Firefox: Spidermonkey , Google Chrome: V8 according to the ECMA script.
- The first JS Engine was spidermonkey which was breated by creator of JS.

- JS Engine Architecture 
a. Code Parsing b. Compilation c. Execution 
- Syntax parser generates AST(Abstract Syntax Tree) which is produced after parsing level.
- After the parsing, the compilation and execution go hand-in-hand. During compilation phase,
AST is interpreted and during this time it is also converted to the optimized code by the
compiler. So, the role of the compiler to optimize the code as soon as possible during the run
time.


- Memory heap is a space where all variables and functions are assigned memory. It is in
constantly sync with the call stack and the garbage collector.
- Garbage Collector frees up the memory heap whenever required. It uses Mark & Sweep
algorithm to sweep off unnecessary stuffs from the code.
